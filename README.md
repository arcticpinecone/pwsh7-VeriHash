# VeriHash

VeriHash is a PowerShell 7+ tool for computing and verifying SHA256 file hashes.

üîÅ PowerShell 7 is a modern, open-source, *cross-platform* edition of PowerShell. 
üõü It can be safely installed alongside the built-in Windows PowerShell without causing conflicts.

**Note:** PowerShell 7 (also known as PowerShell Core) is different from the older Windows PowerShell (version 5.1) that comes pre-installed with Windows 10/11. 

## Changelog
Version: 1.0.3 - 2024-12-07
   - Cleaned up the README.md
   - Skip digital signature check if file is over 1GB. 
   - Now prints completion and timing.
   - Adding VeriHash to your PowerShell Profile (Super Handy!)

## Why PowerShell 7?

- üîÅ **Modern and Cross-Platform:** PowerShell 7 runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making VeriHash more widely usable.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Active Development:** PowerShell 7 receives regular updates, performance improvements, and new features.
- üõü **No Conflict with Windows PowerShell:** Installing PowerShell 7 does not remove or break the existing Windows PowerShell. Both can coexist, allowing you to explore this tool without losing any native capabilities.

If you're new to PowerShell 7, here are some quick pointers:

1. **Installation is Simple:**
   On Windows, you can install PowerShell 7 from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/PSWindows) or download the installer from the [official GitHub releases page](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases). 
   On macOS or Linux, you can follow the straightforward instructions provided in the [PowerShell Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/).

2. **Running VeriHash with PowerShell 7:** 
   After installing PowerShell 7, open a **PowerShell 7 console** (often listed as `pwsh` on Windows). Navigate to the directory containing `VeriHash.ps1` and run:
   
   ```powershell
   .\VeriHash.ps1
   ```
   
   See also: [[# Adding VeriHash to Your PowerShell Profile]] for an easy way to just use it from anywhere like:
   ```powershell
   verihash filename.ext
   ```

3. **Secure:** 
   PowerShell 7 supports execution policies and script signing, just like the older Windows PowerShell. You remain in control of what scripts you run. VeriHash itself is a simple hashing tool with transparent source code, allowing you to inspect it before running if you like.


## Features

- **üöÄ FAST** 
- **SHA256 Hashing:** Compute SHA256 hashes for any file.
- **Verification from `.sha2_256`:** Verify files using automatically generated `.sha2_256` files.
- **Input Hash Comparison:** Compare a computed hash against a provided input hash.
- **Interactive File Selection (Windows):** If no file is given, easily select one via a file dialog.

---
## Requirements

- **PowerShell 7+** is required to run VeriHash.
- Works on Windows and non-Windows platforms. On non-Windows, you'll be prompted to enter a file path manually instead of using a dialog.

## Execution Policy (Optional)

- On some Windows systems, you may need to allow running this script. In PowerShell 7, run:

  ```bash
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

This command allows locally created scripts like VeriHash to run without being blocked while still maintaining some security. You can always revert this by running Set-ExecutionPolicy Default.

---
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arcticpinecone/pwsh7-VeriHash
   ```

   **Clone the Repository** (Alternative):
   Clone the repository into a folder named `VeriHash` for brevity:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arcticpinecone/pwsh7-VeriHash VeriHash
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd VeriHash
   ```

3. Run `VeriHash.ps1` in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   .\VeriHash.ps1
   ```
---
## Usage Examples

### 1. Compute a SHA256 Hash for a File

If you provide just a file path, `VeriHash` will compute and display its SHA256 hash. 
If the hash is SHA256 (the default), it also creates a `.sha2_256` file in the same directory.

```powershell
.\VeriHash.ps1 "C:\path\to\yourfile.exe"
```

### 2. Verify Using a `.sha2_256` File

If you run `VeriHash` on a `.sha2_256` file:
```powershell
.\VeriHash.ps1 "C:\path\to\yourfile.exe.sha2_256"
```
It will verify that `yourfile.exe` matches the stored hash. 
If the referenced file isn't found or the hash doesn't match, you'll be notified.

### 3. Compare Against an Input Hash

Provide both the file and a known-good hash to verify. Use the `-hash` parameter! 
```powershell
.\VeriHash.ps1 "C:\path\to\yourfile.exe" -hash "ABC123456"
```
`VeriHash` will display whether the computed hash matches the input hash.

### 4. Interactive File Selection

Just run:
```powershell
.\VeriHash.ps1
```
If no path is given, on Windows you can select a file using a GUI dialog. 
On other systems, you'll be prompted to type the path.

## Use Cases

- üî¨ **Software Integrity Checks:** 
  Downloaded a new piece of software? Compute its SHA256 hash and compare it to the vendor-provided hash.

- üîê **Automated Verification in CI/CD:** 
  Integrate VeriHash in your build pipeline to verify that build artifacts haven't been tampered with.

- üíæ **Backup Integrity Checks:** 
  Generate `.sha2_256` files for backups and run periodic checks to ensure no corruption over time.

## Speed

Hashing speeds depend on your hardware.

   - On SSDs, hashing can exceed 190 MB/second (~40 seconds for 8GB files).
   - While HDDs may hash at ~93 MB/second (~88 seconds for 8GB files). 
   - Smaller files are processed almost instantly, while 10GB files may take ~1-2 minutes.

### Tested Approximations

- **SSD Speeds:**  
  5 seconds for 1GB, 40 seconds for 8GB, 53 seconds for 10GB.

- **HDD Speeds:**  
  11 seconds for 1GB, 88 seconds for 8GB, 110 seconds for 10GB.

**üí° Tip:** 
   - For large files, feel free to grab a ‚òï, üçµ, or stretch your legs. ü§∏
   - For small files (<500MB), expect the process to complete almost instantly. ‚ö°

## **Adding VeriHash to Your PowerShell Profile**

You can add `VeriHash` to your PowerShell `$PROFILE` for quick and easy access from any directory. This example demonstrates how to create a custom function that wraps `VeriHash.ps1` and accepts parameters.

#### **On Windows 10/11**

1. **Find Your PowerShell Profile Path:**
   Open PowerShell 7 and run:
   ```powershell
   $PROFILE
   ```
   This will return the path to your PowerShell profile file, typically:
   ```
   C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
   ```

2. **Edit Your Profile:**
   Open the profile file in a text editor (create it if it doesn‚Äôt exist):
   ```powershell
   if (-not (Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
       New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
   }
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

3. **Add a Custom `verihash` Function:**
   Add the following function, updating the path to `VeriHash.ps1`:
   ```powershell
   function verihash {
       param (
           [string]$FilePath,
           [string]$Hash
       )
       & "C:\Users\<YourUsername>\source\repos\VeriHash\VeriHash.ps1" $FilePath -hash $Hash
   }
   ```

4. **Save and Reload Your Profile:**
   Save the file and reload your profile:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

5. **Usage:**
   Now you can run `verihash` from anywhere:
   ```powershell
   verihash -FilePath "C:\path\to\file" -Hash "ABC123..."
   ```
   Or simply:
   ```powershell
   verihash "C:\path\to\file"
   ```

### **On macOS/Linux with PowerShell 7**

For macOS/Linux, the steps are similar but paths differ. Use the following steps:

1. Find your profile path:
   ```powershell
   $PROFILE
   ```
   Typical path: `~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

2. Edit or create your profile:
   ```powershell
   if (-not (Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
       New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
   }
   nano $PROFILE
   ```

3. Add the custom `verihash` function:
   ```powershell
   function verihash {
       param (
           [string]$FilePath,
           [string]$Hash
       )
       & "/path/to/VeriHash.ps1" $FilePath -hash $Hash
   }
   ```

4. Save and reload your profile:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

5. Use `verihash` as shown above.
